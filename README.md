# Clustering Crypto

This assignment I pulled various crypto data, cleaned the data to produce a workable dataframe, and standardized it to reduce Dimensions using PCA. I also clustered the cryptos using K-means and found the best "k" using the Elbow Curve. Finally, I visualized the data to produce 3D-Clusters, Tables of Tradables, and a scatter plot with Tradable Cryptos. Overall, I really enjoyed this exercise. It's really helpful to be able to filter the tradable digital assets from the non-tradables. This will be helpful to filter my own tradable assets in Futures and Forex as well.
